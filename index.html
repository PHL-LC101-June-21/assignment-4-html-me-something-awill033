        <h2>New Beginnings</h2>

          <p id=testP class="funParagraph">In 2015 I flew across the world and went on a Working Holiday to explore the Pacific Island Nation of New Zealand. I had met two New Zealanders,
             Amy and Yarnisae, here in Florida and they invited to come over to visit them and travel the country.
             I started out in the Hawkes Bay Region than months later I started my road trip. I started out in the southern part of the island 
             in the capitol city of Wellington. Then I spent 4 months working in the Hawkes Bay Region during rugby season. Finally I became homesick and decided 
             to weave my way north hitting various sites of interest til I finally ended up in the most popolous city in the country, Auckland. 
             Here are some highligts of my trip.
          </p> 

        <h2>Hawkes Bay</h2>

            <figcaption>Here is the Men's and Women's rugby teams posing after the men had a game.</figcaption>
          </figure> 
          <p>Hawkes Bay was the region in New Zealand where I spent the most time. It is known as an agricultural region with many large apple orchards
             and vineries. It also has sheep and cattle farms. While there I found a job working at an apple orchard and decided to stay with Amy and Yarn 
             in the city of Hastings for a few months to give me an opportunity play a full season of rugby and to see New Zealand from a native's 
             perspective and learn more about their culture. I am really thankful that the girls and their families were so welcoming and willing to share
             everything with me. Amy is a New Zealander of European descent and Yarn is Maori, the name of the indigenous people of New Zealand. Through 
             Yarn's family I got to eat native foods, see Haka dances performed, and understand a litte of Maori history and their relationship with the 
             government which is quite different than the history and relationship that the indigenous people of United States have with our government. 
          </p>  
          <p>The city where I stayed in Hawkes Bay is called Hastings. It is not a large town but it is one of the biggest in the regions. Most people
               work in agriculture or doing service jobs such as delivery drivers, working at restaurants/hotels or at places like the hospital or schools.
               I would say life there is centered around family, sports and animal husbandry/crop tending if you have a farm. I was impressed with how close
               families are, particularly Maori ones. It was common for couples to have at least 3 or 4 kids, many grandkids and it seemed like first cousins 
               are raised more like siblings. Relatives would get together on the weekend to watch pro sports games and barbeque. And those who played sports
               often have strong loyalty to a particular sports club so they would see one another multiple times at week at various practices. 
               Speaking of sports, New Zealand is one of the most active countries in the world. Rugby, cricket, and netball are popular team sports and
               the terrain lends it self to outdoor sports such as mountain biking, sailing, rock climbing, and other extremem sports. I particularly was
               excited to play rugby since it is one of the main sports there and the New Zealand citizens are among the best in the world at it.

        <h2>Wellington</h2>

          <p>Wellington is the capitol city and one of the largest metropolitan areas in New Zealand. One weekend I traveled there with Amy and Yarn
             and Amy for her triplet cousins' 21st birthday party. We went a day early to explore the city a bit and do some sightseeing. While in 
             Wellington we stayed in an impressive flat in the city center that belonged to Yarn's Aunt who works in the city's government.
             A highlight of our tourist day was that there was a street food festival going on so I had the opportunity to try some food 
             from kiwis (term of endearment for New Zealanders) of foreign descent. There was Indonesian, Malaysian, Indian, and food from other island nations.
             Most of it was things that are not commonly eaten in the US so the foodie in me was excited to try it all. The next day we spent with the triplets. 
             We started off at dinner at a restaurant in the city center then left to bar hop around downtown. At one point in the night Amy's brother called us
             and said to come watch his drag show at a bar called "Hugh's". It was very interesting to see what nightlife in another county is like. I did
             pretty much feel the same as the U.S. with some small differences. </p>
          
        <h2>Tauranga</h2>

          </figure> 
          <p>Tauranga is a sunny coastal city in the Bay of Plenty Region of New Zealand. It is known for its temperate climate and many parks and 
             beaches where you can find people participating in all kinds of outdoor activities amd water sports. It also has beatiful bush covered 
             mountains that contain waterfalls and lakes. McLaren Falls Park is a popular destination where one can hike, camp, and kayak the river. We spent two
             days camping there and enjoying nature. After camping we toured around town for a few hours looking for souvenirs and interesting street murals.
             In the city center there were many shopping plazas, art galleries and other cultural stores.

        <h2>Taupo</h2>

          </figure> 
          <p>One weekend I decided to take a trip to the town of Taupo with Amy, Yarn and their friend Jess. Taupo is a popular tourist town located on Lake Taupo, the 
             largest lake in New Zealand. It is a hotbed of volcanic and geothermic activity. One of my favorite things we did in the area was take a 
             30 minute car ride out to a nature resorts of sorts that had swimming pools and access to a hot springs. The water was so relaxing and the
             mud supposedly has medicinal properties. Taupo also has a Maori village cultural attraction. The village was built to recreate what life
             what like is Maori villages before the Euorpeans came. You can eat food cooked in underground coal ovens, get a traditional stick and poke tattoo,
             and buy Maori bone and jade jewelry. You can also see the staff perform shows where they dress in traditional garb and do weaving, blacksmithing or 
             perform dances.</p>
